May Term Attendance/Participation Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A student may miss one class unexcused without penalty. After one
unexcused absence, a student's final grade will be lowered 3% for each class
missed, not including the original one. So missing three classes will be a
6% penalty on the final grade.

Excused absences are those approved by the Academic Dean, or by prior permission
of the instructor. Absences for sporting event functions are normally run
through Dean's office. E-mail me that you will be gone so that I can check
you off as excused.

Note: To be counted as attending class, the student must be present when the
instructor takes attendance. If a student during class, he or she will be
counted as absent.
