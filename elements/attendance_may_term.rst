May Term Attendance/Participation Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Missing classes will lower your overall grade. The scale:

* One class: 1% lower
* Two classes: 4% lower
* Three classes: 7% lower
* Four classes: 11% lower
* Five or more: F

Excused absences are those approved by the Academic Dean, or by prior permission
of the instructor. 
Absences for sporting event functions are normally run
through Dean's office. E-mail me that you will be gone so that I can check
you off as excused.

Note: To be counted as attending class, the student must be present when the
instructor takes attendance. If a student leaves early during class, he or she will be
counted as absent.
