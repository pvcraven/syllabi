Contact Hours and Learning Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CMSC 390AG meets three times per week. Class covers 14 weeks, with one week of
break, and one day off for Honor Symposium giving us a total of
39 classes. At 60 minutes per class, that's 39 hours of meeting time.

There will be approximately 3 hours of Unity tutorial videos assigned per week.
Because of pausing/rewinding this should take about 6 hours per week for a total of 78 hours.

Total time outside of class spent on projects, including the final capstone project,
should be about 33 hours.

Total time spent on the class should be about 140 hours, or about 10 hours
per week.
