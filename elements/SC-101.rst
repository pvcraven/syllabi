* Course title:
  SC 101 Joss Whedon Productions
* Catalog course description:
  Joss Whedon has played a part in the creation of two Avengers movies, the
  original Toy Story, and TV shows such as Firefly and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
  His shows are known for playing out difficult cultural issues in fantasy-world
  settings. Real problems people face become literal monsters in his shows. We
  will critically examine how Joss Whedonâ€™s work applies to the metaphorical
  monsters in our own lives. Topics include gender roles, addiction, class,
  sexuality, bereavement, family, relationships, and how we find our own place
  in society.
