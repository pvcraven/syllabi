Written Communication (WC)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Written communication is the ability to communicate successfully via
handwritten, printed, or electronic text.

Writing is an essential skill that students need in order to comprehend,
analyze, and synthesize a variety of texts in a variety of disciplines. In
college, students will learn to write in multiple contexts: in the Simpson

elective courses. Effective writing is also a skill they will find
indispensable in their professional lives beyond the undergraduate academic
setting.

Engaged citizens rely on strong writing skills, whether they are exploring and

perspectives of others, or crafting the polished, compelling and persuasive
expression so often necessary to shaping and creating a diverse and just
community.
