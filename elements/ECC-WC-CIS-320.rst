Written Communication (WC)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Written communication is the ability to communicate successfully via
handwritten, printed, or electronic text.

Writing is an essential skill that students need in order to comprehend,
analyze, and synthesize a variety of texts in a variety of disciplines. In
college, students will learn to write in multiple contexts: in the Simpson

expression so often necessary to shaping and creating a diverse and just
community.
