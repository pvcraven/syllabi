Attendance/Participation Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A student may miss three classes unexcused without penalty. After three
unexcused absences, a student's final grade will be lowered 3% for each class
missed, not including the original three. So missing five classes will be a
6% penalty on the final grade.

Excused absences are those approved by the Academic Dean, or by prior permission
of the instructor. Absences for sporting event functions are normally run
through Dean's office. E-mail me that you will be gone so that I can check
you off as excused.

.. danger:: To be counted as attending class, the student must be present when the
  instructor takes attendance. Continually showing up to class late can really
  hurt a student's grade. If a student leaves class early without prior
  permission, he or she will be counted as absent.
