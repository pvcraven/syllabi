Attendance/Participation Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A student may miss three classes unexcused without penalty. After three
unexcused absences, a student's final grade will be lowered 3% for each class
missed, not including the original three. So missing five classes will be a
6% penalty on the final grade.

Excused absences are those approved by the Academic Dean, or by prior permission
of the instructor. Absences for sporting event functions are normally run
through Dean's office. E-mail me that you will be gone so that I can check
you off as excused.

.. danger:: To be counted as attending class, the student must be present when the
  instructor takes attendance. Showing up to class 10 minutes late does not count
  towards attendance. Therefore continually showing up to class late can really
  hurt a student's grade. If a student leaving class early with prior
  permission will be counted as absent.

**COVID-19 Update:** Because of COVID-19 you may need to attend via Zoom.
You'll still be counted as attending if you need to attend via Zoom. Because
it is easy to fall asleep during Zoom meetings, there may be polls during class
to keep people engaged. If so, you'll need to answer these polls to be counted
as attending.
