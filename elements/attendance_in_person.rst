Attendance/Participation Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A student may miss three classes unexcused without penalty. After three
unexcused absences, a studentâ€™s final grade will be lowered 3% for each class
missed, not including the original three. So missing five classes will be a
6% penalty on the final grade.

Excused absences are those approved by the Academic Dean, or by prior permission
of the instructor.

Note: To be counted as attending class, the student must be present when the
instructor takes attendance. If a student during class, he or she will be
counted as absent.
