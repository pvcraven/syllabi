The Arts (AR)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The arts are a vital component of human existence. They provide an opportunity
to experience and express the world in ways distinct from other disciplines.
The Arts component of the General Education curriculum focuses on learning
through participation in artistic creation. By taking a course that engages
students in the act of creation, students will develop an understanding of art
as a constructed means for communication, designed to reveal certain meanings
and ideas or to elicit specific responses. Students are given the opportunity
to develop their imaginations and to develop their ability to express
themselves.

The general education program prepares students to become engaged citizens by
exploring enduring questions about ourselves, civilization, and the world and
by developing the skills necessary to shape and create a diverse and just
community. As an organizing principle, citizenship encourages an emphasis on
issues of personal integrity, moral responsibility and social justice. The arts
