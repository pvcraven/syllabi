Contact Hours and Learning Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When doing a capstone as a 386 class instead of a 385 class, students should
be spending 10 or more hours per week with a supervisor performing work related
to their degree. Another option is to work with a different professor and do
10 or more hours per week on related research.

The reports should take approximately 30 minutes to write each week.
With 13 weeks in the course, the total number of hours involved should be
approximately 136 hours.
