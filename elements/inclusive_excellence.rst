Respect for Diversity
=====================

It is my intent that students from all diverse
backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course.
Diversity that students bring to this class should be viewed as a resource,
strength and benefit.
It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of
diversity: gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, socioeconomic status,
ethnicity, race, culture, perspective, and other background characteristics.

Your suggestions about how to improve the value of diversity in this course
are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the
effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or
student groups.

If I have inadvertently scheduled an exam or major deadline that creates a
conflict with your religious observances, please let me know as soon as
possible so that we can make other arrangements.
