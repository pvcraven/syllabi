Late-Work/Make-up Work Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* All work must be turned in on-time.
* Late work is not accepted, unless approved ahead of time by the instructor.
* All work must be turned in by the end of the time scheduled for the class
  final. No extensions beyond this date/time are given unless you have a
  form filled out and signed for an "incomplete."
* Extra-credit / make up work is not offered.
* If you need to use the lab for doing work, make sure to understand when the
  lab is open. The McNeill lab is usually closed on Sunday nights, and
  assignments are due Monday morning. Not knowing when the lab is open is not
  accepted as an excuse.
* If you are asked to use ``git`` to turn in homework, make sure you understand
  how to merge code. It isn't fun to have ``git`` reject your push when trying
  to finish it up the night before it is due.
