Critical Thinking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Critical Thinking courses develop the lifelong intellectually disciplined
process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing,
synthesizing, and/or evaluating information that is used to guide beliefs and
actions. This skill helps with the ability to make sound arguments based on
adequate evidence and to rationally examine and assess one’s own arguments and
those of others.

Through completion of a CT course, students should be able to

* draw conclusions by analyzing information critically
* generate and articulate an argument supported by appropriate evidence
* evaluate arguments for validity, bias, unchecked assumptions and/or other
  appropriate criteria
* describe the effect of one’s experiences on the development of critical
  thinking skills

These objectives will be met through the following assignments and activities: _____ .
