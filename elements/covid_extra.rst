Special Covid Additions
-----------------------

Thanks to COVID here are some additional elements:

Wearing Facial Coverings in Classrooms is Required
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To help mitigate the transmission of COVID-19, it is required that all students, faculty, and staff wear masks in
classrooms, laboratories, and other similar spaces where in-person instruction occurs. This requirement is for all
individuals regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. The masks must cover both nose and mouth and be worn for the
duration of class. Consumption of food or drink will not be allowed inside classroom spaces. Mask requirements
(both within the classroom and inside campus buildings) will be linked to Simpson College
`COVID-19 <https://simpson.edu/covid19-plan>`_ Color Phases
and will be evaluated frequently. Please note that Color Phases are heavily influenced by the vaccination rate
on campus. You can find more information at COVID-19 Plan. Non-compliance regarding masks may result in students
being asked to leave the class, disciplinary action from the academic dean, or failure of the class as outlined
in the
`Student Handbook Standards of Classroom Behavior <https://simpson.edu/internal/academics-home-page/academic-policies#Standards%20of%20Classroom%20Behavior>`_.

COVID-19 Health-Relates Class Absences
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please evaluate your own health status daily and refrain from attending class if you are ill. Students who miss class
due to illness will be given opportunities to access course materials and will not be penalized for not attending
class in person. Please work with instructors to either reschedule or electronically/remotely complete exams, labs,
and other academic activities as you are able. You are encouraged to seek appropriate medical attention for treatment
of illness. In the event of contagious illness, please do not come to class or to campus to turn in work. Notify me
by email about your absence as soon as practical so that accommodations can be made. Please note that documentation
(a doctor's note) for medical excuses is NOT required.


Additional Contingency Plans
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Should the normal instructional activity on the campus be shortened or
interrupted by a campus-wide closing, students will receive information from
the instructor or other representative of the college about when and if the
course might be continued or completed remotely.

Recording Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Recording: Class meetings may be recorded by the instructor for student use.
To respect the class community, there shall be no other audio or video recording
of class activities and no sharing or disseminating recordings or images
(including screen shots) of class activities without the permission of the
instructor and other members of the class.
