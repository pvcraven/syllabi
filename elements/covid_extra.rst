Special Covid Additions
-----------------------

Thanks to COVID here are some additional elements:

Wearing Facial Coverings in Classrooms is Required
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To help mitigate the transmission of COVID-19, it is required that all students,
faculty, and staff wear masks or face shields in classrooms, laboratories, and
other similar spaces where in-person instruction occurs. The masks/shields must
cover both nose and mouth and be worn for the duration of class, inside all
college buildings, and outside whenever you are or are likely to come within
6 feet of another person.

COVID-19 Health-Related Class Absences
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please evaluate your own health status daily through the Moodle Check-In and
refrain from attending class if you are ill. Students who miss class due to
illness will be given opportunities to access course materials online and will
not be penalized for not attending class in person. Please work with instructors
to either reschedule or electronically/remotely complete exams, labs, and other
]academic activities as you are able. You are encouraged to seek appropriate
medical attention for treatment of illness. In the event of contagious illness,
please do not come to class or to campus to turn in work. Notify me by email me
about your absence as soon as practical so that accommodations can be made.
Please note that documentation (a Doctorâ€™s note) for medical excuses is NOT
required.

Additional Contingency Plans
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Should the normal instructional activity on the campus be shortened or
interrupted by a campus-wide closing, students will receive information from
the instructor or other representative of the college about when and if the
course might be continued or completed remotely.

RECORDING POLICY
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Recording: Class meetings may be recorded by the instructor for student use.
To respect the class community, there shall be no other audio or video recording
of class activities and no sharing or disseminating recordings or images
(including screen shots) of class activities without the permission of the
instructor and other members of the class.
