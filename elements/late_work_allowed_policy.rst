Late-Work/Make-up Work Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* All work should be turned in on-time.
* Late work will be assigned a penalty:

  * 1-3 calendar days: 5%
  * 4-7 calendar days: 10%
  * 8-10 calendar days: 15%
  * 11-14 calendar days: 20%
  * 14+ calendar days, not accepted

* All work must be in by midnight, April 29th.
  No extensions beyond this date/time are given unless you have a
  form filled out and signed for an "incomplete."
* Extra-credit / make up work is not offered.
* If you need to use the lab for doing work, make sure to understand when the
  lab is open. The McNeill lab is usually closed on Sunday nights, and
  assignments are due Monday morning. Not knowing when the lab is open is not
  accepted as an excuse.
