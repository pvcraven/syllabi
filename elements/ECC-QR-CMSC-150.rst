Quantitative Reasoning (QR)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Quantitative reasoning is the application of quantitative concepts and skills
to solve real-    world problems for the purpose of making decisions. To
effectively use quantitative reasoning requires understanding how to interpret,
evaluate, and use various types of quantitative information in order to support
a position or argument. It includes the ability to express quantitative
information visually, symbolically, numerically and verbally (including written
or oral communication).

In order to perform effectively as professionals and citizens, students must
become competent in reading and using quantitative data, in understanding
quantitative evidence and in applying quantitative skills to the solution of
real-life problems such as choosing the financing for a new home, how to live
a sustainable lifestyle, and whether to vote for or against a specific tax. The
purpose of embedding the Quantitative Reasoning skills in application courses
is to provide our students with quantitative problem-solving experiences at
the college level within the context of the content of other college courses.
The goal is to instill long-term patterns of interaction and engagement with
quantitative problem solving.
