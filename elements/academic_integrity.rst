Academic Integrity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Simpson's Statement:**
In all endeavors, Simpson College expects its students to adhere to the
strictest standards of honesty and integrity. In keeping with the College’s
mission to develop the student’s critical intellectual skills, while fostering
personal integrity and moral responsibility, each student is expected to abide
by the Simpson College rules for academic integrity. Academic dishonesty
includes (but is not limited to) any form of cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized
collaboration, misreporting any absence as college-sponsored or
college-sanctioned, submitting a paper written in whole or in part by someone
else, or submitting a paper that was previously submitted in whole or in
substantial part for another class without prior permission. If the student
has any questions about whether any action would constitute academic dishonesty,
it is imperative that he or she consult the instructor before taking the action.
All cases of substantiated academic dishonesty must be reported to the student’s
academic advisor and the Dean for Academic Affairs. For further guidance on these
rules and their sanctions, please see the college catalog.

**My addition:**
Students are strongly encouraged to work with one another on homework; however,
blatant copying of assignments will be considered cheating.

If I get two assignments that are the same thing, both people will get zeros.
Guard your homework carefully, so it is not used as a source for cheating.
Don't e-mail it to a friend so they can 'use it to learn' or 'as a template'.
Don't allow someone to simply read off what you have on your computer screen.
By allowing someone to cheat, that will allow the person to get behind in what
they understand, and they will never catch up.

A student caught cheating will either get a zero for the assignment, have
his/her over-all letter grade reduced, or be flunked from the course.
Cheating students may be required to do extra work.

The instructor keeps a database of prior assignments and assignments commonly
found on the Internet. The instructor will periodically run scans to look for
duplicate assignments. We catch students cheating every. single. year.
Don't do it.

Regardless, cheating is like paying for a gym membership, and then sending someone
else to work out for you. It doesn't make sense. You aren't going to get
stronger that way.
