* A live web server must be maintained using Amazon Web Services.

  * This will require an AWS account linked to a credit card. AWS offers one
    year of very basic level service free. If you are past that year there
    will be a nominal charge.
  * Make sure you shut down your servers at the end of class so you don't keep
    getting charged.
  * See the instructor if you are not able set up your own server.
