Grading
^^^^^^^

Grades will be calculated on a percent scale. The percentage is calculated by
total points earned, divided by total points possible. If there is an attendance
penalty, then that is subtracted next.

.. danger:: Sometimes Simpson's Scholar site shows the wrong grade.
    If it does this, it will show your total class
    score to be too high.

* Scholar will not show your attendance penalty, if that applies.
* If there is a missing grade that hasn't been set at zero, then Scholar will
  not show that in the average. For example, if there are 10 assignments, each
  worth 100 points, but one is missing, Scholar will show your average as 100
  instead of 90. I do try to go back and enter zero on missing assignments so
  Scholar shows the correct grade, but sometimes that isn't practical.
* I've had a few semesters where the average score presented by Scholar is pure
  fiction, I'm not sure why.

If you want to calculate your grade, total up your points, divide by the total possible.
Then take into account any attendance policy penalty.
