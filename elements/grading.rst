Grading
^^^^^^^

Grades will be calculated on a percent scale. The percentage is calculated by
total points earned, divided by total points possible. If there is an attendance
penalty, then that is subtracted next.

.. danger:: Sometimes Simpson's Scholar site shows the wrong grade.
    If it does this, it will show your total class
    score to be too high.

* Scholar will not show your attendance penalty, if that applies. You can look
  up your attendance on Scholar.
* If there is a missing grade that hasn't been set at zero, then Scholar will
  not show that in the average. For example, if there are 10 assignments, each
  worth 100 points, but one is missing, Scholar will show your average as 100
  instead of 90. I do try to go back and enter zero on missing assignments so
  Scholar shows the correct grade, but sometimes that isn't practical.

If you want to calculate your grade, total up your points, divide by the total possible.
Then take into account any attendance policy penalty.
See the `attendance policy <#attendance-participation-policy>`_.

**Appealing your final grade:** If you believe your final grade is in error,
please go through the effort of calculating your grade yourself.
Total up your points earned and the total points possible for the class.
Calculate the percentage. Check your attendance. Include that information
when contacting the instructor.

**Appealing an assignment grade:** Please do this within a week or two of the
grade being posted. Please regularly check for missing assignment grades.
After final grades are posted, I'll only re-examine assignments
turned in during finals. I'm not going back a to look at early
assignments. Turning in tech assignments can be more complex than turning in
a paper, so it is critical to notice right away if you are missing a piece.
