Grading
^^^^^^^

Grades will be calculated on a percent scale. The percentage is calculated by
total points earned, divided by total points possible. If there is an attendance
penalty, then that is subtracted next.

.. danger:: Sometimes Simpson's Scholar site shows the wrong grade.
    If it does this, it will show your total class
    score to be too high.     

Please note that Scholar will not show your attendance penalty if that applies. Also, if
there is a missing grade that hasn't been set at zero, then the total grade average
won't take this into account. I will when final grades are calculated.
I've had a few semesters where the average score presented by Scholar is pure fiction,
I'm not sure why.

If you want to calculate your grade, total up your points, divide by the total possible.
Then take into account any attendance policy penalty.
