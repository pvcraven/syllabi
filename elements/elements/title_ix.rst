Sexual and Relationship Misconduct
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Simpson College strives to create an environment free from sexual or
relationship misconduct of any kind; and in which those who have experienced
sexual misconduct get the help and support they need.  Simpsonâ€™s Sexual and
Relationship Misconduct Policy outlines expectations the college has students
and employees, including faculty. In order to do all that we can to maintain a
safe campus community, and in compliance with Federal law, all employees of the
college are expected to report knowledge of alleged sexual misconduct to the
Title IX Coordinator.  Therefore, if you reveal to me, in conversation, writing,
class discussion, or in any other manner, that you have experienced sexual
misconduct it is my obligation to share that information with the Title IX
Coordinator on our campus.  Please know that if this is a step that needs to be
taken, I will do my best to involve you in that process so that you know what
to expect as a result of the communication with the Title IX Coordinator. To
learn more about the expectations the college has of you with respect to sexual
misconduct, you can find the full policy here:
