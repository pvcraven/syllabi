attend the other, please do. Please e-mail me a note so I can make sure to
mark you as having attended.

Assignments
^^^^^^^^^^^

All assignments have two parts. A **lab** and a **quiz**. The quiz will be done
on-line with Scholar. The quiz is done outside of class, and you may use the
book to complete it. The lab must be checked into BitBucket, and then a link
to the folder submitted on-line through Scholar.

Quizzes will be worth 10 points, and labs will be worth 20 points. The exception
will be Assignment 13, which will not involve any quizzes, and it will be worth
60 points.

.. note:: Labs can be resubmitted once for more points.

Labs may be resubmitted for a regrade up to one week after they are graded.
So if you turn in an assignment on the 8th and it is graded on the 10th at 10 am,
then it can be fixed and submitted for a regrade any time up to the 17th at 10 am.

To resubmit a lab you must resubmit it for grading on Scholar. Otherwise I won't know
to grade it. Committing and pushing the file to Bitbucket isn't enough.

You may only resubmit a lab once, unless the first time was just a missing graphic or
something like that.

Exceptions: Time during Fall and Thanksgiving Break isn't counted towards the seven days. All
assignments and regrades must be in by Wednesday Dec 13 at 12:15 pm, even if
you didn't get seven days.
