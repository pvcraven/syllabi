mark you as having attended.

Assignments
^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three types of assignments:

* Labs - 20 points, except the final lab which is 60 points
* Quizzes - 10 points
* On-line coding problems

The on-line coding problems are new, and I'm not sure how often we will
have them, or how they will be graded. Right now I am leaning towards two
points per problem, with an assortment of problems due at the same time as
these problems below.

Assignments are due by the time indicated below:

* Monday, Jan 15 at 8 am:

  * Lab 1: First Program (Initial setup, BitBucket check-in, and
    simple program.)

  * Quantitative Reasoning Reflection (20 points)
  * Quiz 13

* Wednesday April 25 at 12:15 pm:

  * Lab 12 - Final project due. No meeting for final. (60 points)

.. note:: Labs can be resubmitted once for more points.

Labs may be resubmitted for a regrade up to one week after they are graded.
So if you turn in an assignment on the 8th and it is graded on the 10th at 10 am,
then it can be fixed and submitted for a regrade any time up to the 17th at 10 am.

To resubmit a lab you must resubmit it for grading on Scholar. Otherwise I won't know
to grade it. Committing and pushing the file to Bitbucket isn't enough.

You may only resubmit a lab once, unless the first time was just a missing graphic or
something like that.

Exceptions: Time during Spring Break isn't counted towards the seven days. All
assignments and regrades must be in by Wednesday April 25 at 12:15 pm, even if
you didn't get seven days.
