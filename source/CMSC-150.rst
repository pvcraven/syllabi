Assignments
^^^^^^^^^^^

All assignments have two parts. A **lab** and a **quiz**. The quiz will be done
on-line with Scholar. The quiz is done outside of class, and you may use the
book to complete it. The lab must be checked into BitBucket, and then a link
to the folder submitted on-line through Scholar.

Quizzes will be worth 10 points, and labs will be worth 20 points. The exception
will be Assignment 13, which will not involve any quizzes, and it will be worth
60 points.

This course is getting updated, so the exact nature of the assignments might
change from what is listed below.

Labs may be resubmitted for a regrade up to one week after they are graded.
So if you turn in an assignment on 1/8 and it is graded on 1/10 at 10 am,
then it can be fixed and submitted for a regrade any time up to 1/17 at 10 am.

Exceptions: Time during Spring Break isn't counted towards the seven days. All
assignments and regrades must be in by Wednesday Apr 26 at 12:15 pm, even if
you didn't get 10 days.
