Assignments
^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three types of assignments:

* Labs - 20 points, except the final lab which is 60 points
* Quizzes - 10 points
* On-line repl.it coding problems, 2 pts each

.. note:: Labs can be resubmitted once for more points.

Labs may be resubmitted for a regrade up to one week after they are graded.
So if you turn in an assignment on the 8th and it is graded on the 10th at 10 am,
then it can be fixed and submitted for a regrade any time up to the 17th at 10 am.

To resubmit a lab you must resubmit it for grading on Scholar. Otherwise I won't know
to grade it. Committing and pushing the file to Bitbucket isn't enough.

You may only resubmit a lab once, unless the first time was just a missing graphic or
something like that.

Exceptions: Normally time during Fall and Thanksgiving Break aren't counted towards the
seven days, although that doesn't matter this year.
