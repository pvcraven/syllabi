Grading
^^^^^^^

Grades will be calculated on a percent scale. The percentage is calculated by
total points earned, divided by total points possible.

Note: Simpson's Scholar website uses the software program "Moodle." Sometimes
Moodle shows
an incorrect class total score. If it does this, it usually shows your total class
score to be too high. To be certain of your grade, add all your points and
divide by the total possible. Do not trust Moodle to show the correct class
score.
