Academic Integrity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In all endeavors, Simpson College expects its students to adhere to the
strictest standards of honesty and integrity. In keeping with the College’s
mission to develop the student’s critical intellectual skills, while fostering
personal integrity and moral responsibility, each student is expected to abide
by the Simpson College rules for academic integrity. Academic dishonesty
includes (but is not limited to) any form of cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized
collaboration, misreporting any absence as college-sponsored or
college-sanctioned, submitting a paper written in whole or in part by someone
else, or submitting a paper that was previously submitted in whole or in
substantial part for another class without prior permission. If the student
has any questions about whether any action would constitute academic dishonesty,
it is imperative that he or she consult the instructor before taking the action.
All cases of substantiated academic dishonesty must be reported to the student’s
academic advisor and the Dean for Academic Affairs. For further guidance on these
rules and their sanctions, please see the college catalog.
