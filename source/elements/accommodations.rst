Accommodations for Students with Accessibility Needs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I want everyone in this class to be successful. If you have a physical, sensory,
learning, or psychological disability that can interfere with your learning, I
want you to receive the accommodations to which you are entitled by law. In
order for me to do provide accommodations to a student, the student’s disability
must be documented with the Student Accessibility Office.  I cannot assist a
student with accommodations that I don’t know are needed, so if you need
something, please make sure that you either contact me or that you ask Simpson's
Student Accessibility Coordinator, to do so on your behalf.  If you
have any further questions on the policies and services for students with
disabilities, please refer to the academic catalog or go to
