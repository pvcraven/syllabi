Course Continuity Plan
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Should the normal instructional activity on the campus be shortened or
interrupted by a campus-wide closing, students will receive information
from the instructor or other representative of the college about when and if
the course might be continued or completed via Internet, telephone, or
United States mail.
