Student Assessment
------------------

Assignment Submission
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are six assignments. A student's grade for each assignment will depend
on how many 'mini-projects' were completed.

Each mini-project of an assignment must be checked off in-person or via video conference.
You should then submit which steps were completed via Moodle, and the I will
verify a match between my records and yours. If there is a discrepancy, I'll
contact you to make sure you get the proper grade.

Quizzes will be done on-line. Open book. You can ask other students and even
the instructor.
