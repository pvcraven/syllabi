Assignments
^^^^^^^^^^^

* For each chapter there will be an on-line quiz. Each quiz will be scaled to 10 points.
* For each lab, there will be a lab report worth 10 points.
  Lab reports are done with a lab partner most of the time. If your one partner does not show up on the day we work
  on the lab, then the work will need to be done and turned in separately.
* For each lab, there will be an on-line lab assessment worth 10 points. Each person must complete the quiz separately.

This is a new class for me, so the exact timing on when chapters and labs are due will be determined as we
go on. But I hope to cover about 10 chapters and 10 labs over the course of our 13-14 weeks.
