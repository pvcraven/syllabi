Assignments
^^^^^^^^^^^

We will be following the textbook for assignments.

* For each chapter there will be an on-line quiz worth 50 points. There are 15 chapters, but I think we'll probably
  only get to 13 or 14 of them.
* For each lab, there will be a lab report worth 100 points. There are 10 labs.
* We may include ad-hoc projects along the way. These will be either 50 or 100 points, depending on the effort.
* The final will be a book report, worth 200 points.
