Assignments
^^^^^^^^^^^

We will be following the textbook for assignments. There will be:

* Chapter quizzes (10 points)
* Lab reports (10 points)
* Lab quizzes (10 points)

There are about 10 labs and chapters to cover. All assignments are scaled to
10 points. So if there are 40 questions in a quiz, each quiz will be worth 1/4
of a point.

What we will have for a final, and the number of points for the final, is
yet to be determined.
