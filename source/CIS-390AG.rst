The first 1/3 to 1/2 of the class will be on building skills. The last half will be working in one or more teams
on a cooperative project using the Agile methodology.

To begin with, we will cover the following topics, and have an assignment for each one:

* Initial tutorial on Blender
* Initial Unity concepts
* Basic C#
* Unity Roll-a-ball
* Learning to move assets from Blender to Unity
* Using Git with Unity, managing forks, branches and pull requests
* Agile methodology

After that we will introduce the final project and move into "sprints" where we will grade work on a weekly basis.
