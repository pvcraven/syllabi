CIS 120 Introduction to Web Development
=======================================

.. include:: ../elements/CIS-120.rst

Note
^^^^

There are many different areas of web development. We will be just scratching
the surface of the subject. We will cover the main types of technical web
development, except for programming. Programming for the web is covered in the
second semester.

Note: Most people find this class starts out hard and gets easier.

We will cover:

* Version Control (hard)
* Server/Cloud Setup (hard)
* HTML (medium)
* CSS (medium)
* Content Management Systems (easier)
* Static Content Generators (easy)

Just like a survey course in Sports, History, or Religion, you may find
there are parts of this that you like and wish we covered more, and others less.
Imagine you got to teach a course
labeled "Sports" in college. What sports would you cover? And in how much depth?
What sports would you have students try out?
